This project demonstrates how to split a Python program into modules.

- `one.py` contains utility functions like greeting, addition, and checking even numbers.
- `two.py` imports these functions and uses them inside a main() function.
- This modular structure improves code reusability and organization.

To run this project:
1. Ensure both files are in the same directory.
2. Run `two.py` using a Python interpreter.
